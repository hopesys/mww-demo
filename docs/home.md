## 2. Contest Overview Text

The overview text should articulate the core philosophy of the pageant, distinguishing it from traditional beauty competitions.

*   **Core Concept:**
    *   **Headline:** *"Beauty with Wellness"*
    *   **Description:** Miss Wellness World is an international pageant aiming to find women who can be role models for wellness across 30+ countries. It serves as a new compass pointing towards "sustainable beauty" and "true happiness" for humanity.
*   **The Three Pillars of the Contest:**
    The pageant is founded on three core ideas:
    1.  **Beauty:** Defined not just by physical appearance but by the integration of three attributes:
        *   *Compositionality:* Harmony of components.
        *   *Proportionality:* Appropriate proportions.
        *   *Integrationality:* Integration of inner mind and spirit with outer appearance.
    2.  **Happiness:** Focusing on "true happiness" from within (positive attitude, good relationships, meaningful ideals) rather than temporary pleasure.
    3.  **Wellness:** A state of completeness in body, mind (thoughts/emotions), and spirit (conscience/values).
*   **The Goal:**
    *   To discover **"Wellness Ambassadors"** who inspire the public to prioritize health, balanced lifestyles, and nutrition, while driving the "Global Wellness Movement".
