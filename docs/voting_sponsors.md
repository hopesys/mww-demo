# VOTING and SPONSORS

## 1. VOTING: Global vs. Thai

The voting systems for the international and Thai stages share some similarities but have distinct operational differences, particularly regarding payment methods and contestant identification.

### **A. Miss Wellness World (Global Stage)**
*   **Concept:** Voting is designed to allow the audience to support representatives from over 30–40 countries.
*   **Mechanism:** The proposed system involves users selecting the **photo of the contestant** along with their **country** on the official website.
*   **Payment & Logistics:** The exact system for international money transfers was still under determination.
*   **Website Requirements:** The website development plan suggests a need for a "Voting System" that could potentially include purchasing voting points (via Credit Card or QR Code) and might display real-time scores (Leaderboard).

### **B. Miss Wellness World Thailand (MWWT)**
*   **Concept:** This voting system is specifically for the 30 finalists chosen from the audition rounds.
*   **Mechanism:** Voters select a contestant's photo, which is assigned a specific code ranging from **MWWT01 to MWWT30**.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Selection:** Choose the image/number of the contestant.
    2.  **Payment:** Perform a money transfer (specifics on "transfer steps" and "how to check balance" are part of the system design).
    3.  **Closing Time:** The voting system is scheduled to close **1 day before the Final Round** to allow for the clearing and calculation of scores.
*   **Side Stages:** The "Angel of Wellness" (Kids 8-12) and "Princess of Wellness" (Teens 14-17) pageants utilize a similar voting system to MWWT, featuring photos and personal information.
